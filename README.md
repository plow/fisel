File System Encryption Layer

A set of Python scripts wich recursively encrypt a whole file system directory such that it can be safely copied e.g. to a public cloud storage without relinquish privacy. The encryption ensures that not even the storage provider can analyse your data - neither the the directory structure, nor the filenames, nor the file contents.
